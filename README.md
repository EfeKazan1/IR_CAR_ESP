# IR_REMOTE_CAR ESP32
My first robotic project
The car has rgb led, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
The car stops engines when you hold button 0, starts engines when holding 1, is able to going forward backwards, turn right and left and button 9 to tank spin
The leds provides us to understand which direction are we going yellow to starting engines purple for stopping engines,blue for going forward, green for going backward, disco mode for tank spin and finally red for HC-SR04 detects obstacle.
When the car detect an obstacle it instantly going backwards for one sec.
